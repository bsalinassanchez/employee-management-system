### Technologies
I built this application using React, Node.js, express, MySQL, Javascript, HTML, and CSS

### Setup
- download or clone the repository

client setup:
- cd into client folder
- run `npm install`

server setup:
- cd into server folder in seperate terminal

### Status
I plan to update this application by updating the dashboard and allow the employeer to have more functionality and control over employees. For example, being able to update salary or other variables in an employees account.
